       I am a poet, copywriter and musician based in Brooklyn. My poems have appeared in H_NGM_N, Fields, Public Pool and Tenderloin, among other journals. I currently make music with Continue (featuring Anomylos Ensemble members), Charmers (we interpret the music of Django Reinhardt) and Gillian. My chapbook, Chords, was published in 2016 by the Operating System.
